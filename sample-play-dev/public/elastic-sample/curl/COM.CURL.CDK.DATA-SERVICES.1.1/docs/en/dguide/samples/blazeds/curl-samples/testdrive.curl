        In this test drive, based on the BlazeDS Flex test drive, you run a
        series of short sample applications that demonstrate the key features of
        CDK-DS using a BlazeDS server. We walk you through the source code of
        each application to highlight the key points of its implementation.

        }
    },
    {paragraph
        The application file specifies the destination and endpoint to
        instantiate a RemoteObject. A call to getProducts() is made when you
        click on the "Get Data" button. An event handler on the operation
        populates a RecordGrid with a RecordSet derived from the result.

    {paragraph
        Curl is an object-oriented language that fully supports markup and
        scripting. This distinguishes it from other development platforms in
        that you do not have to cobble together your application using several
        different languages. You can develop your models, views, controllers
        (or any design pattern), along with markup, behaviors, or whatever your
        application needs, all in Curl.
    },
    {paragraph
        In this sample, there is a user-defined class called TileSelector which
        encapsulates the presentation characteristics of the phone catalog. The
        TileSelector class uses a variety of Curl graphical components, and
        demonstrates event handling for value changes and selection.
    },
    {paragraph
        The main application file, s-101.curl, demonstrates markup,
        presentation, data-binding, and scripted behavior in response to
        various events.
    },
    {paragraph
        Also note that Curl supports style sheets, a simple but powerful way to
        apply your own look and feel to your applications. The use of style
        sheets also allows graphic designers to work independently of, and in
        parallel with application developers.

    {paragraph
        In s-update.curl the \{adapters.register-package\} method is used to
        register data object classes in this Curl package with data objects sent
        from the server. As a result, Product objects returned by the
        getProducts() method of ProductService are deserialized into instances
        of the Curl Product class. Similarly, the instance of the Curl Product
        class passed as an argument to the update method of the RemoteObject is
        deserialized into an instance of the Java version of the Product class
        at the server-side.

        This sample sets up a Consumer which allows the user to subscribe to or
        unsubscribe from a message service. When the service feed is running,
        and the application is subscribed to it, the Consumer receives
        MessageEvents indicating that a message has been published by the feed
        and delivered to the Consumer. The Curl application extracts the message
        from the MessageEvent and displays it.
