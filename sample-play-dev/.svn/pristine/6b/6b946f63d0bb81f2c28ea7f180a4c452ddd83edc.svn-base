}

{summary    
    The {docref COM.CURL.CDK.MESSAGING} package
    provides a {docref Producer} and {docref Consumer} adapters
    for exchange of messages with AMF service providers.

    This allows Curl applications to participate in
    Publish / Subscribe message exchange.

{heading level=2,    
    Producer and Consumer
}
{paragraph
    Use {ctext Producer} and {ctext Consumer}
    to participate in pub/sub messaging conversations.

    {itemize
        {item {docref Consumer} represents a source of messages.  
            It receives messages from topics to which the appalication is subscribed.
            Use {docref Consumer.subscribe} to subscribe to a server message source.}
        
        {item {docref Producer} represents a sink of messages.
            It is used to send messages to other subscribed consumers.
            Use {docref Producer.send} to send a message.}
        
        {item Identify the service for {ctext Consumer}s and {ctext Producrer}s
            by specifying the {ctext endpoint} Url
            and the {ctext destination}}

        {item Prepare for the response by adding event handlers to a {ctext Consumer}
            {itemize
                {item {docref MessageEvent} represents an incoming message,
                    and contains its content.}
||--                {item {docref FaultEvent} indicates a failure condition
||--                    and contains information about the fault}
            }}

        {item The content of messages can be any 
            {link href = {url "cdk-ds-overview.curl#amf-protocol"}, AMF Protocol}
            datatype, depending on the requirements of the messaging application.
            Messages usually are {docref DataObject} instances.}
    }
}
{paragraph    
    The {bold Data Push} and {bold Collaboration}
    samples illustrate these techniques.

    Editable source code is available in the
    {link href = {url "cdk-ds-overview.curl#samples-project"}, sample applications}.
