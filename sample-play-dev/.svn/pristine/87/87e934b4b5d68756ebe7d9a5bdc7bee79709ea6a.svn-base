{summary    
    The {docref COM.CURL.CDK.RPC} package
    provides a {docref RemoteObject} adapter
    for invocation of remote methods.

    This allows Curl applications to invoke
    remote methods available from AMF service providers.
}
|| ====================
{heading level=2,    
    Remote Object
}
{paragraph
    Use {docref RemoteObject} to invoke remote methods
    provided by AMF aware servers.

    {itemize
        {item Identify the service
            by specifying the {ctext endpoint} Url
            and the {ctext destination}
            for {ctext RemoteObect}}

        {item Obtain the operation by name 
            using {docref-abbr AbstractService.get-operation}}

        {item Prepare for the response by adding event handlers to the operation (or service)
            {itemize
                {item {docref ResultEvent} indicates a successful call,
                    and contains the result returned}
                {item {docref FaultEvent} indicates a failure condition
                    and contains information about the fault}
            }}

        {item Invoke the operation,
            by supplying the arguments  to {docref Operation.send}}
    }
}
{paragraph
    The {bold Remote Object} sample illustrates these techniques.

    Editable source code is available in the
    {link href = {url "cdk-ds-overview.curl#samples-project"}, sample applications}.
}
{x-code-ref title = {message Remote Object},
    background = "beige",
    {samples-loc.merge "testdrive-remoteobject/s-remoteobject.curl"}
}
{paragraph
    Communication with the server is asynchronous,
    so that the application can remain active
    while awaiting a response from the server.
    The application provides event handlers to react 
    to results (or failure notifications) from the remote service.

{heading level=2,    
    Remote Object Datatypes
}
{paragraph
    Requests and responses to remote object services are repesented using the
    {link href = {url "cdk-ds-overview.curl#amf-protocol"}, AMF Protocol},
    a compact binary serialization protocol.

    The following datatypes are supported:
    {itemize
        {item primitives
            {itemize
                {item {docref bool}}
                {item {docref null}}
                {item {docref String}}
                {item {docref int}}
                {item {docref double}}
                {item {docref DateTime}}
            }}
        {item structures
            {itemize
                {item {docref DataObject}}
                {item {docref Array}}
                {item {docref ExtendedArray}}
                {item {docref ByteArray}}
                {item {docref AMFXmlDocument}}
            }}
    }
}
|| ====================
{heading level=3,    
    Data Adapters
}
{paragraph
    The protocol encodes objects as collections of properties,
    represented by {docref DataObject} instances.  
    These are characterized by their {docref DataObjectTraits}.

    It is possible to map named {ctext DataObject}s
    to a Curl {docref Class},
    by registering an adapter that specifes the
    {docref DataObjectTraits} corresponding to that class.

    Note that Curl variable naming conventions differ from
    those of {ctext Java} and {ctext ActionScript}.
    Class member variables are converted accordingly
    by the traits adapter, so that, for example,
    {ctext product-id} becomes {ctext productId}.

    Use {docref AMFObjectAdapters.register-class} to register an adapter.
    The traits can be specified as a class variable {ctext traits},
    or by keyword argument.

    Use {docref AMFObjectAdapters.register-package} to
    register all classes with a {ctext traits} class variable
    in a package.

    By default, AMF serialization and deserialization
    uses adapters defined by {docref AMFObjectAdapters.standard}.
    If it is necessary to use particular adapters for some
    {ctext RemoteObject} instance, it can be supplied
    explicitly using the {ctext mapper} keyword
    when constructing an {docref AMFChannel}.
