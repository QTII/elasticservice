{doc-next
    {purpose
        Object used to make remote calls to a server.

  field public source:#String

  {doc-next
    {purpose
        Create a {docref RemoteObject} with some server information.
    }
    {parameter endpoint,
        The {docref Url} of the server that this object is
        going to communicate with.  Also if no {param channel-set} is
        provided, this will be used to make a {docref ChannelSet} wrapped
        around a {docref AMFChannel}.
    }
    {parameter destination,
        The destination at the {param endpoint} for all messages being sent.
    }
    {parameter channel-set,
        A {docref ChannelSet} to use to send messages, this will be
        implicitly created from the {param endpoint} if it is not supplied.
    }
    {parameter ...,
        {docref EventHandler}s to receive events on this object.
    }
    {notes
        The {docref EventHandler}s on this object can receive
        {docref ResultEvent}s, {docref InvokeEvent}s, and {docref FaultEvent}s
        for all messages sent and received through this object.  If events
        for just a single request are desired, add the {docref EventHandler}
        to the {docref Operation} returned by
        {docref AbstractService.get-operation} on this object.
    }
